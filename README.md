# Eduatar Chatbot

The Eduatar Chatbot is an AI-powered project designed to facilitate access to information on the Swiss apprenticeship system. It serves apprentices, teachers, and parents by automating responses to frequently asked questions using cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) and deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview

**Objective**: To develop an intelligent chatbot, Eduatar, using large language models (LLMs) for automating responses to common queries about Swiss apprenticeships

**Key Features**:
- **Automated Responses**: Quick and reliable information on topics like working hours, compensations, and legal questions
- **Advanced NLP Techniques**: Utilizing state-of-the-art LLMs like GPT-3.5/4 and VICUNA for accurate and relevant answers

## Methods

The project methodology encompasses:
1. **Dataset Generation**: Building a dataset tailored for fine-tuning BERT-style models
2. **Model Selection & Fine-Tuning**: Evaluating and fine-tuning models like BERT, GPT-3.5, and VICUNA
3. **Pipeline Setup**: Implementing a retriever-reader model using the LangChain framework
4. **Model Evaluation**: Employing manual and automated methods to assess model performance

## Folder Structure
- **`admin/`**: Contains Documentation and project reports detailing the methodology, results, and future work
- **`evaluation/`**: Includes scripts and metrics for evaluating the performance of different models
- **`implementation/`**: Core implementation files including training scripts, model configuration, and inference code

## Conclusion
This project establishes a foundational proof of concept in the application of LLMs for educational chatbots. Further research and development are required to optimize the performance and utility of such systems.
